   	The perfect burger should be juicy, tender and have some serious grill marks on the outside. How do you achieve this,
   	 you ask? Add a bit of water to the mix â€” this will ensure the patties stay deliciously moist as they cook.
   	 Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat production worldwide, after
   	  pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively.[1] In absolute numbers, the United States, Brazil, and the People's Republic
   	   of China are the world's three largest consumers of beef. On a per capita basis in 2009, Argentines consumed the most beef at 64.6 kg per person;
   	    people in the U.S. ate 40.2 kg, while those in the E.U. ate 16.9 kg.
